								<h3 class="major">Our Story</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/lovestorycartoon.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>How We Met</h4>
								<p>
									It all started over 15 years ago, in the most unexpected place—karate class. We bonded over sparring sessions, perfecting our flying sidekicks, and supporting each other during our black belt tests. Though we lost contact in our early adult years, life had different plans for us, and we reconnected in the most modern way—on Facebook in early 2020.</p>
								<p>
									It might have seemed like Mysti just reached out to check in on Sean, but there was more to it. She secretly thought he was cute and hoped he felt the same way! At the time, the world was changing with the onset of Covid, and we found ourselves spending more time together. Sean had just moved into a new apartment in Neenah, and Mysti was often there with him, getting to know his world and, of course, his son, Greyson.
								</p>
								<h4>Our New Beginning</h4>
								<p>
									On May 7th, 2020, we officially began dating, marking the start of a new chapter. Mysti moved into Sean’s apartment shortly after, and it was then that we became our own little family of three. Since that time, we've had countless adventures, exploring new places and making memories together. We don't have a "spot"; instead, we have many spots—everywhere we go becomes a special place because we're together and find joy in always finding new spots to go.
								</p>
								<h4>Our Journey Together</h4>
								<p>
									Our story has been full of growth, change, and deep connection. As we’ve navigated life side by side, we’ve shared many milestones that have shaped us into the couple we are today.
								</p>
								<p>
									After we began dating, Sean dove into college while also balancing life as a father. Mysti was there to support him every step of the way—whether it was offering encouragement during late-night study sessions or celebrating his achievements. Through the ups and downs, we learned how to balance our individual goals while growing closer as a couple. He is so close to graduating, we could not be more excited and Mysti could not be more proud.
								</p>
								<p>
									As our family grew, we also focused on ensuring Greyson had the support he needed. We worked together to make sure he received the care and therapy for his autism. Watching Greyson thrive and reach new milestones has been one of our greatest joys. Our love and dedication to him have only strengthened our bond as a family.
								</p>
								<p>
									In 2023, we made a big move together to a lower duplex in Appleton, creating a new home and a fresh start. With our growing family, it was important to have a space that reflected our dreams and aspirations for the future. It’s been a place to build more memories, share laughter, and settle into the next phase of our journey.
								</p>
								<p>
									We've also had our share of adventures and challenges, including navigating life with one car for a while! From figuring out how to get from point A to point B, to finally getting new cars, we've made it work, finding humor in the little things and always supporting each other no matter what.
								</p>
								<p>
									One of the best things about our relationship has been our ability to find new experiences together. Whether it’s enjoying holiday activities, exploring fairgrounds, camping under the stars, or catching a concert together, we’ve never stopped seeking out new things to enjoy as a couple. Every day is an opportunity to create a new memory, and we love that about our relationship. We don’t need a fixed spot—we have countless places, moments, and memories, from the biggest adventures to the simplest joys, that mean the world to us.
								</p>
								<p>
									Through it all, we have remained each other's biggest supporters, learning how to grow as individuals and as a family. The challenges, triumphs, and experiences we’ve shared have only deepened our love for one another. We are stronger, wiser, and more in love than ever, and we can't wait to see what the next chapter of our journey holds as we begin our married life together.
								</p>
								<h4>The Proposal</h4>
								<p>
									Though Mysti had always dreamed of an engagement, she never expected it to be a surprise. But, surprise it was! On October 4th, 2024, Sean took Mysti to High Cliff State Park, where he got down on one knee. Mysti was so caught off guard that she immediately told him to stop, unsure of what was happening! Sean, nervous and thinking Mysti really wanted him to stop, froze for a moment. But, when she playfully pushed him back down onto one knee and told him to continue, he did, of course. And the rest is history!
								</p>
								<p>
									Sean definitely listened to Mysti when it came to her choice of ring! Her ring has received more compliments on the opal than the diamonds! (yes, there are both!)
								</p>
								<h4>Our Future Together</h4>
								<p>
									Now, as we look ahead to our wedding on February 28th, 2026, we are beyond excited to begin this next chapter as husband and wife. Our journey together has been filled with surprises, love, and countless memories, and we can’t wait to see what the future holds for us.
								</p>
								<p>
									Here’s to forever with our person—our partner, our best friend, our love.
